# Qualcomm SNPE Inference
A yolov7 tiny model inference applied qualcomm snpe for the pedestrian detection on the multirotor with gstreamer pipeline.

## 1. Overview
To minimize the inference time cost, we just reduce the input image size and detection classes. The yolov7 model is trained on the x86 PC first with 23 classes (include human, some animals and vehicles) from the coco dataset. And after evaluating the performance of the model, we first apply the `export.py` tool from the yolov7 to convert the PyTorch torch scripts `*.pt` into `onnx` format. Then, we could use [netron](https://netron.app/) to visualize the the architecture of the model, and decide where to trim the node (or check whether snpe supports). At last, we use the qualcomm snpe sdk tools to convert the `onnx` format into `*.dlc`, which is usable for the snpe container.

For realtime application on drone, we create a multi-threading processing pipeline, one threading just keep receiving the image from gstreamer caps and convert it into opencv format (`cv::Mat`) and then just push it into a buffer queue that we designed. The other threading in other hand, popping the image out and inference the image with Qualcomm SNPE container and then transmit the processed image to the indicated ground station.

## 2. Quick Start
1. Setup Qualcomm `SNPE` software develop kit
2. Configure the GStreamer pipeline and model container path in [`config.json`](./cfg/config.json). You could test the pipeline is portable first, and then apply it into `VidepPipeline`.
3. Build the project with CMake.
    * `$ mkdir build && cd build`
    * `$ cmake ..`
    * `$ make`
4. Excute the project with `$ ./snpe_task`
5. Make sure the ground control station has already in process.
6. (optional) Run the `gst-client` as the ground control station to receive the processed image. 
    * `$ source client/gst-client.sh`
